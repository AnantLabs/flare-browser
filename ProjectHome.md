> Flare has been tested on Windows XP Home, Pro, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008 and Windows 7.

### How to use Flare ###
> After installation completes visit Start > All Programs > Flare
> If you've not used Flare before it will ask you for your account name, username and password, there's also a "Notifications" tab for you to customise how Flare will notify you of new messages. Don't worry if you can't decide now, you can always reach the settings dialog by opening File on the main menu and selecting Settings.

> Once Flare has logged into your account you'll see your campfire lobby, enter the rooms you want to. Flare will open a tab for each room you enter, and keep you in that room until you decide to leave it.

> You can leave a room by pressing the tab close button, marked with an "x", to the far right of the tabs.


> You can either leave Flare running in the background, or minimise it to the notification tray.

> Each time you receive a message into a room you're not currently focused on (either because the window is hidden by another, is minimised or you're in another room in another tab, Flare will notify you non-intrusively by showing a semi-transparent notification in the bottom-right of your primary screen.

> If you miss the preview, don't worry - Flare's icon will glow orange until you next view the window.
